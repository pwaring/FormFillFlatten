1. Upload all the files in the repository to a directory on your server.

2. Download the latest version of the iText JAR file from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/itext/files/

Save this file to the same directory as FormFillFlatten.java, and
rename it itext.jar.

3. Download the latest version of JSON-java from:

https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java

4. Download the latest version of junit from:

https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads

Save this file to the same directory as JSON-java and rename it
junit.jar.

5. Change to the directory containing JSON-java and run:

javac -classpath junit.jar:. *.java
mkdir -p org/json
mv *.class org/json/
jar cf json-org.jar org

6. Copy json-org.jar to the same directory as itext.jar

7. Run the following command to compile the Java class:

javac -classpath itext.jar:json-org.jar:. FormFillFlatten.java

You should now have a FormFillFlatten.class file.

8. Set up a new virtual host for this domain.

9. Copy public_html/index.php to the document root of your virtual host.

10. Copy the following files to the directory above the document root:

FormFillFlatten.class
itext.jar
json-org.jar

11. Edit JAVA_PATH in index.php so that it matches the path to the
java command on your system. You can find this by running:

which java

In most cases the default should suffice (/usr/bin/java).

12. Change TMP_DIR to reflect the location for temporary files on your
system. The default should be fine on Linux.
