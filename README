FormFillFlatten is a RESTful web service which allows users to upload a
PDF template containing form elements, together with the values which
should used to fill those placeholders. FFF populates the form fields
and returns a 'flattened' PDF, which allows no further editing.

This software uses iText, which is licensed under the AGPL, and as such
FormFillFlatten is also AGPL licensed. A copy of the AGPL can be found
in the file LICENCE in the root directory of this project.
